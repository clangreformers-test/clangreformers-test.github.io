I"˛<p>‚ÄúCase Studies of Chinese Language Reformers‚Äù is a non-profit organization registered with the U.S. federal government and the state of California. Its main goal is to collect, categorize, study, and write about the people and events that lead to the standardization and modernization of today‚Äôs Chinese language. We hope to preserve the history of an important stage of modern Chinese language development. We believe this piece of history will help us understand modern Chinese culture and education. It will also help us appreciate and honor the great contributors who shaped the language.</p>

<p>At one point in China, people from different places spoke their own dialect, and words did not have a common meaning. ‚ÄúWords with universal meaning and language with universal pronunciation‚Äù had been a dream of the late Master Li Jinxi and his students. Today that dream has become a reality. Students, whether they come from mainland China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, can learn Mandarin Chinese through PinYin or ZhuYin. With a dictionary annotated with PinYin or ZhuYin, everybody can learn Standard Chinese and speak the same Mandarin Chinese. Regardless of which province or town they come from, people can communicate using Mandarin Chinese without hinderance.</p>
