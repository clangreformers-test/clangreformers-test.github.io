    <p> We are a group of 2nd and 3rd generation family and friends of the leaders of the Chinese language modernization. Most of us are busy working professionals in our daily lives. But we are spending time and resources to collect, investigate, and write to preserve this important piece of history. This is an ongoing effort, and this web site will be updated with new content as we make progress.</p>

Yingxian Wang, Granddaughter of Shuda Wang
<p>I grew up in my grandparents house until I was ready to go to school. I knew that grandpa is a Chinese Language scholar. He is one of the major contributors to "Modern Chinese Dictionary". Almost everyone in mainland China has a copy. Grandpa was several of his brothers and a sister's high school Chinese teacher. He taught me and my cousins Pinyin before we started reading. When I was in elementary school, I sometimes opened the page containing my grandpa's name  in "Modern Chinese Dictionary" and showed it to my classmates. They looked at me with admiration. However, Grandpa lived a very low key life. So I never thought that he was an extradinary person.</p>

<p>After finally having the breathing room from busy working and family  life, my cousins and I  suddenly realized it is our responsibility to record the extraordinary contributions Grandpa's generation made to modern Chinese. Why? His generation lived through the end of Qing Dynasty,i the establishment of the Republic of China, the Japanese occupation, the ani-Japanese war/second world war, the Chinese civil war, the retreat of the Republic of China to Taiwan, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and through the Cultural Revolution. They experienced the highs and lows of life. Many records, books, resource materials are lost in battle fires, political turmols, and moving places. </p>

<p>After finding the few documents and photos left by grandpa, we are lucky to connnect with Mr. Peter Wang, the younger son of Mr. Shoukang Wang. Mr Wang and our grandpa were colleagues on many occasions. They were both students of Master Jinxi Li, who is one of the greatest modern Chinese Linguist who invented the Pinyin. They both worked on "Chinese Daily", the daily newspaper for promoting Mandarin. They were both early members of the "Chinese Dictionaries Compilation Center". Mr. Wang were invited by the then Taiwan province governor together with a number of young teachers to spread standard Chinese pronounciations to Taiwan. Please refer to Mr. Peter Wang's article "Professor Li's Students" for the story. We realize that Master Li together with Mr. Wang, Grandpa and their students have made great contributions to the standardization and modernization of Chinese pronounciation and meaning. We feel greatly honored to be able to 
commemorate their works.</p>

<p>To give us a platform to collaborate with other people, we established a non-profit, tax  exempt organization -- Case Studies of Chinese Language Reformers. The organization aims to collect, organize, and write about the people and events involved in Chinese language standardization and modernization. The organization was approved to be tax-exempt status in August, 2019. We appreciate the difficulty of this endeavor. Most of the people who were involved in the early stage have passed away. However, we will do our best, because we feel this piece of history has far reaching meanings  for modern Chinese culture and education.</p>
