"Case Studies of Chinese Language Reformers" is a non-profit organization registered with the U.S. federal government and the state of California. Its main goal is to collect, categorize, study, and write about the people and events that lead to the standardization and mordenization of today's Chinese language. We hope to preserve the history of an important stage of modern Chinese language development. We believe this piece of history will help us understand modern Chinese culture and education. It will also help us appreciate the great contributions and characters of the participants..

At one point, in China, people from different places spoke their own dialect. Words didnot have a common meaning. "Words with common meanings, language with same pronounciation" has been a dream of the then Master Li Jinxi and his students. Today that dream has  become a reality. Students,  whether they come from mainland China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, can learn manderin Chinese through PinYin or ZhuYin. With a dictionary annotated with PinYin or ZhuYin, everybody can learn standard Chinese, speak the same manderin Chinese. Regardless where you come from, people can communicate using manderin Chinese without hinderance.
