"Case Studies of Chinese Language Reformers" is a non-profit organization registered with the U.S. federal government and the state of California. Its main goal is to collect, categorize, study, and write about the people and events that lead to the standardization and mordenization of today's Chinese language. We hope to preserve the history of an important stage of modern Chinese language development. We believe this piece of history will help us understand modern Chinese culture and education. It will also help us appreciate the great contributions and characters of the participants..

《中國語言標準化現代化進程中的人與事》是在美國聯邦以及加州註冊的非營利免稅機構。它的主旨是收集，整理，研究，和撰寫對中國語言標準化現代化做過貢獻的人和事。我們希望通過這個工作來保留現代中國語言發展歷史的一個重要階段。我們相信這段歷史會幫助我們了解現代中國文化，教育， 以及當時這些人的奉獻和品質。

At one point, in China, people from different places spoke their own dialect. Words didnot have a common meaning. "Words with common meanings, language with same pronounciation" has been a dream of the then Master Li Jinxi and his students. Today that dream has  become a reality. Students,  whether they come from mainland China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, can learn manderin Chinese through PinYin or ZhuYin. With a dictionary annotated with PinYin or ZhuYin, everybody can learn standard Chinese, speak the same manderin Chinese. Regardless where you come from, people can communicate using manderin Chinese without hinderance.

曾經幾何，在中國， 不同地方的人都是操著自己的方言說話，而文字也沒有統一的意思。今天，黎錦熙大师以及他的學生們當年“字同意，語同音” 的夢想已經得以實現。無論在中國大陸，台灣或香港的小學生們如果學過漢語拼音或注音符號。再拿上一本有標注漢語拼音或注音符號的字典。就可以學習正統的國語，說標準的普通話。無論你來自中國的哪一個地方，甚至香港或台灣，大家都可以用普通話或國語無障礙的交流。
